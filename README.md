# Kimberly Cohane, Ph.D. - Data Analyst Portfolio

## About

Hi, I'm Kimberly! I've worked in Data Analytics for over 3 years using data to uncover meaningful insights. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science. 

In my Ph.D. program, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained hands-on experience in data management and statistical analysis, which has really sharpened my analytical skills.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques. I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. I enjoy discovering new insights and using data to solve complex problems.
